	// Each area is represented as a rectangular grid where each driver
	// anyonymously signs in (i.e. the server only knows the driver is located
	// in the area).
	//
	// First, the rider generates an ephemeral key pair (riderSk, riderPk), which she
	// uses to encrypt her coordinates. She then sends the tuple (riderPk, enc(coordinates))
	// to the server handling the area she is in.
	//
	// Once the public key and the encrypted rider coordinates of the rider
	// have been received by the server, the rider's public key is transferred
	// to all the drivers within the area, with a randomized different index
	// for each of them, that indicates in which coefficient each driver must
	// encode her coordinates.
	//
	// Each driver encodes her coordinates in the designated coefficient and
	// uses the received public key to encrypt her encoded coordinates.
	// She then sends back the encrypted coordinates to the server.
	//
	// Once the encrypted coordinates of the drivers have been received, the server
	// homomorphically computes the squared distance: (x0 - x1)^2 + (y0 - y1)^2 between
	// the rider and each of the drivers, and sends back the encrypted result to the rider.
	//
	// The rider decrypts the result and chooses the closest driver.
